# WEB_SCRAPING_USING_API
## by Mostafa Hasan


## Extracting data on currency exchange rates using the python requests library
In this Jupyter Notebook, I will scrape the exchange rates website using API, then I will: 
- Obtain the historical exchange rates.
- Extract data for a time period.
- Test the API response to incorrect input.
- Create a simple currency converter.
